  <h1>Free Software</h1>
  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      All of the software that I create
      is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
      software</a> available under
      the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General
      Public License</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word "free" used here means <em>freedom</em>, it isn't about
      price (though my programs do happen to be available at no
      cost). Freedom here means that you have the right to run, copy,
      study, change, and redistribute my programs, provided that you
      extend that same freedom to others.
    </p>
