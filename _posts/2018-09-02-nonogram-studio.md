For personal reasons, my work on developing [Nonny](/projects/nonny/)
has ended, and there will be no further updates aside from minor bug
fixes. However, my commitment to creating the best possible computer
nonogram experience has not wavered, and I have been actively working
on what will be Nonny's successor.

That successor is called Nonogram Studio. The project is in the early
stages but progress is steadily being made. I can offer no further
details at this time.
