[Nonny](/projects/nonny/)'s first pre-release is here! Nonny is a game
in which you can play and create nonogram puzzles. Nonograms are a
type of logic puzzle originating in Japan. Each puzzle has a grid of
squares, and each square can be filled in or left blank. Numeric clues
at the sides of the grid tell you how many squares to fill in and in
what order.
